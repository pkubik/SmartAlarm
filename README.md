SmartAlarm
==========

An Android application prepared for a moble development course on WUT.

The application monitors the traffic and manages the alarm clock in order to
help the user in avoiding traffic jams. The application turns off the alarm
clock to allow the user to sleep in until the difficulties are over. Note
that not everyone can afford such behaviour!
